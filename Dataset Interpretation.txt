The dataset describe the SOH, SOE and Q of 67 battery packs at different state of charge.

What values are changing:

SOC, SOE, individual cell's voltage reading, SOH(does not change for the same battery)

Visible relationship:
for the same battery: when SOC +, SOE +, charge +, SOH remains 

Suggested Relationship to predict SOH:
1. Ui voltage vs SOH
2. Q vs SOH
3. SOE vs SOH
4. SOC vs SOH
