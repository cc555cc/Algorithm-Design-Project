The dataset describe the SOH, SOE and Q of 67 battery packs at different state of charge.

What values are changing:

Measured Capacity(doesn't change all), State of Charge, State of Energy, Cell's Voltage Reading, SOH(doesn't change at all for each battery pack)

Relation:
1. SOC vs SOH sort by SOC value
2. SOE vs SOH : sort by SOE value
3. Q vs SOH : sort by measured capacity
4. V(with SOC, SOE, Q value) vs SOH : sort by battery id
5. Combine all model
