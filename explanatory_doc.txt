EXPLANATORY DOCUMENT - Battery Pack SOH Prediction 
----------------------------------

Overview:
This part of the project focuses on predicting the State of Health (SOH) of battery packs using a
Linear Regression model trained on the PulseBat Dataset.

From Gorup Code: 
- Created initial data reading and random splitting logic.
- Implemented iteration through dataset rows and extraction of numeric data (U1–U21).
- Established foundation for dataset processing (read_data(), split_data()).

(Added Functionality):
1. Completed full data preprocessing using pandas.
   - Handled missing values and extracted U1–U21 cell voltage readings.
   - Aggregated individual cell voltages to compute an average pack voltage.

2. Implemented Linear Regression Model:
   - Used scikit-learn's LinearRegression() for training.
   - Split data into 80% training and 20% testing.

3. Evaluated Model:
   - Computed R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

4. Applied 0.6 Threshold Classification:
   - Added logic to label each battery as “Healthy” or “Problem” based on predicted SOH.

5. Exported Results:
   - Generated `soh_predictions.csv` containing real vs. predicted SOH and classification results.
